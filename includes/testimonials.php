          This is my first experience with ITCERTG and I liked it. Great way to receive PMP Certificate
          without traveling. The exam was well organized and the instructions given by Vignesh were clear.
          The best part is that they collect payment <b>after the exam</b> — a great deal!

          Today I passed my certification which was pending for long. Received 206 questions from ITCERTG for
          a 200-mark exam and completed it two hours early. I’ll definitely take help from ITCERTG again.
          Thank you!
